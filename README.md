MIcons-Builder
==============

MIUI Icons Builder/Configurator

This project was greated for personal use. To help the "icon-builder-community", i release this into the wild. 

You can use this without my permission and pack your themes ;). It would be great if the community can help me
and add more features in the future. I would love to hear your ideas and thoughts.


You only have to edit the config.php. Please don't remove the credits, because some stuff is used from other 
authors and it's always good to give credits!

I left some sample-icons in the whole project so it's easier to set up your own working-enviroment.
